Warning messages:
1: In if (my.names != "none") { :
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used
2: In `names<-.data.table`(`*tmp*`, value = c("id", "class", "pos",  :
  The names(x)<-value syntax copies the whole table. This is due to <- in R itself. Please change to setnames(x,old,new) which does not copy and is faster. See help('setnames'). You can safely ignore this warning if it is inconvenient to change right now. Setting options(warn=2) turns this warning into an error, so you can then use traceback() to find and change your names<- calls.
